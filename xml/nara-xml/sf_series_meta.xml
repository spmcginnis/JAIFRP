        <scopeAndContentNote>This series documents the management and disposal of properties and
            goods as identified by the War Relocation Authority (WRA) as directed by Executive
            Orders 9102 and 9066. This series consists of correspondence, reports, and case files
            pertaining to the property of individuals, families, and businesses impacted by
            involuntary evacuation and relocation because of their foreign national status or
            Japanese ancestry. Nationalities include, but are not limited to German, Italian, and
            Japanese. Many of the documents produced at the Los Angeles Branch of the Federal
            Reserve Bank were believed to have been incorporated into this collection while under
            the physical control of the San Francisco Branch. Numerous forms were triplicate, filed
            separately, and there may be multiple copies of a record within this series. Subjects
            covered include internment, military restricted areas, Civilian Exclusion Orders,
            Wartime Civil Control Administration (WCCA), U.S. Employment Service, Farm Security
            Administration, and the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL). Some of the records
            are in Japanese. </scopeAndContentNote>
